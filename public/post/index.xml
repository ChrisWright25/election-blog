      <title>Week 4: Incumbency</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;incumbency-advantage&#34;&gt;Incumbency Advantage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term incumbency is always brought up when discussing forecasting elections, but why? In elections, incumbency is often seen as a boost In other words, those in office tend to stay in office. The graph below shows the percentage of congress members reelected since 1964. The graph supports the idea of an incumbency advantage as both Senators and Representatives have higher  than 60% reelection rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/2024/09/30/week-4-incumbency/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, incumbency at the presidential level is more nuanced and can be analyzed many different ways. One way of defining incumbency is the exact candidate. For example, Obama in the 2012 election would be an incumbent. In the &lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; presidential elections since 1948 with at least one incumbent running, &lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; incumbents have won reelection. Another way of considering incumbency is through party affiliation. For example, Kamala Harris would be an incumbent under this definition. This definition gives less power to the idea of an incumbency advantage as only &lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;  presidential elections have been won by the incumbent party. Lastly, a broad definition of incumbency could be candidates that have served in past presidential administrations. This definition captures candidates like Hillary Clinton who was Obama&amp;rsquo;s secretary of state. Under this advantage the incumbency advantage shrinks even more as only &lt;strong&gt;27%&lt;/strong&gt; of presidential winners since 1948 have served in past administrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Polling</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;gallup.jpg&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; height=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The picture above is of George Gallup. Gallup is considered to be the father of public opinion polling and founded the namesake polling organization, Gallup. Since Gallup revolutionized polling, it has been a mainstay when talking about elections. Although polls are widely conducted and a focal point of campaign news, the validity and accuracy of polls has always been in question. In the 1948 election, polls famously predicted a Dewey victory over Truman and more recently some polls underestimated the support for Trump in the 2016 election. These polling mishaps lead to one essential question: What makes a good poll?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fundamentals I: Economy</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Read my lips: no new taxes&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;ndash; George H. W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite making this promise, Bush later reversed course on the statement and raised taxes. This decision by George H.W. Bush at the 1988 Republican National Convention is often cited as one of the reasons why he lost reelection in 1992. Other one-term presidents like Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter have seen their reelection chances dwindle based on their economic policy and the overall economic performance in the United States. This week, I will further examine the connection between economic performance and an incumbent&amp;rsquo;s reelection chance. To achieve this, I will complete extension 1 by creating several predictive models based on key economic indicators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 1: Electoral Competitiveness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog for GOV 1347. Throughout the semester I will be updating this blog and examining various techniques to forecast the 2024 election. For the first week the focus is electoral competitiveness. This blog will analyze the competitiveness of presidential elections and analyze which state vote Democrat or Republican consistently&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;electoral-competitveness&#34;&gt;Electoral Competitveness&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To examine whether elections in the US are competitive I utililzed a dataset of the presidential popular vote since 1948. Using this data, I plotted the popular vote for the Democrats and Republicans over time. If elections were competitive, you would expect to see lines that are close to one another and a back-and-forth trend in the winner of the popular vote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
